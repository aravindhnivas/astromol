## A Database of Molecules Detected in Space

`astromol` is a Python 3 package that provides a database of molecules detected in space and an object-oriented interface for interacting with the database and generating the figures and tables from the [_Census of Interstellar, Circumstellar, Extragalactic, Protoplanetary Disk, and Exoplanetary Molecules_ by B. McGuire](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/aae5d2).

If you use `astromol` for your own work, please cite the Zenodo entry: [![DOI]()]().

## Setup Instructions

Clone the `astromol` repository to your computer.  It is **not** recommended to clone the `development` branch.

In your terminal, navigate to the `astromol` directory, then install using

`pip install -e .`

The use of the `-e` flag creates a symlink to the package which will enable you to easily check for and download updates to the code by simply using

`git pull`

in the `astromol` directory without needing to re-install.
